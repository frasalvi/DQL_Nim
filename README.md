# DQL_Nim
In this project, we use Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning to train artificial agents that can play the famous game of [Nim](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).

Our experiments and findings are summarized in our [Report](Report.pdf), following the [intructions](Assignment.pdf) of the project.

This work is part of an assignment for the course "Artificial Neural Networks" at EPFL, and is the joint effort of [Francesco Salvi](https://github.com/frasalvi) and [Bruno Ploumhans](https://github.com/Technici4n).
